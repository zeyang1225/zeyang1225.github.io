<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome to my website! I am a four-year PhD candidate at the Von Allmen School of Accountancy, University of Kentucky. I use archival methods and machine learning to understand sustainability issues (artificial intelligence, climate commitments, and human capital) in financial and managerial accounting. My research presented at major conferences and universities across the globe. I participated in AAA Auditing/FARS/MAS doctoral consortiums and AAA Doctoral Student/Faculty Interchange SE. I received the Best Paper Award at 2024 JAAF Symposium on ESG and the 2025 Gatton Doctoral Research Excellence Award.

My teaching aims to infuse artificial intelligence (prompt engineering) and data analytics (Python and Microsoft Access) into accounting information system classroom. I am also actively looking for industry practitioners to share practical insights in my class.

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked as a research associate and taught business statistics at the Australian National University, where I also received two summer research fellowships. I earned a research master’s degree with Chancellor’s Commendation for Academic Excellence from the Australian National University and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology. 

When I'm not teaching or doing research, I enjoy mindfulness swimming, especially going for a one-hour swim at Lancaster Aquatic Centre after teaching two morning class sections. I also enjoy reading history and learn about human decision making through historical stories. I originally come from Zhangqiu of Shandong (the birthplace of China’s philosophy).
