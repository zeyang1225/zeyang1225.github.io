<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome to my website! I am a Job Market Candidate at the Von Allmen School of Accountancy, University of Kentucky. I use archival methods and machine learning to understand technology and sustainability issues (artificial intelligence, climate commitments, and human capital) in accounting. My research presented at major conferences and universities across the globe. I participated in AAA Auditing/FARS/MAS Doctoral Consortium, AAA Doctoral Student/Faculty Interchange SE, and AAA Deloitte Foundation/J. Michael Cook Doctoral Consortium. I received the Best Paper Award at 2024 JAAF Symposium on ESG, the 2025 Gatton Doctoral Research Excellence Award, and the Best Paper Award at 2025 Rutgers Accounting Doctoral Symposium.

My teaching infuses artificial intelligence (prompt engineering) and data analytics (Python and Microsoft Access) into accounting information system class. I am also looking for industry practitioners to share practical insights in my classroom.

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked as a research associate and taught business statistics at the Australian National University, where I received two summer research fellowships. I earned a research master’s degree with Chancellor’s Commendation for Academic Excellence from the Australian National University and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology. 

When I'm not teaching or doing research, I enjoy mindfulness swimming, especially going for a one-hour swim at Lancaster Aquatic Centre after teaching two morning class sections. I also enjoy reading history and learn about human decision making through historical stories. I originally come from Zhangqiu of Shandong (the birthplace of China’s philosophy).
