<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome! I am Jackie Zeyang (pronounced "Zuh-Yahng") Ju, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at the Von Allmen School of Accountancy, University of Kentucky. I use archival method and textual analysis to understand digital technology and sustainability issues (artificial intelligence, climate commitments, and human capital) from the perspective of accounting information. As sole instructor, I infuse artificial intelligence and data analytics into accounting education. 

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked as a research associate and taught business statistics at the Australian National University, where I received two summer research fellowships. I earned a research master’s degree with Chancellor’s Commendation for Academic Excellence from the Australian National University and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology.
