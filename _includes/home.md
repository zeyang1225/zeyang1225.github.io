<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome! I am Jackie Zeyang (pronounced 'Zuh-Yahng') Ju, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at the Von Allmen School of Accountancy, University of Kentucky. I am on the 2025-2026 accounting academic job market. 

My passion is using archival method and textual analysis to understand digital technology and sustainability issues (artificial intelligence, climate commitments, and human capital) from the perspective of accounting information. My research aims to improve corporate transparency and maintain managers’ accountability to firm stakeholders. As sole instructor, my teaching infuses artificial intelligence (prompt engineering) and data analytics (Python and Microsoft Access) into accounting information system course. 

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked as a research associate and taught business statistics at the Australian National University, where I received two summer research fellowships. I earned a research master’s degree with Chancellor’s Commendation for Academic Excellence from the Australian National University and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology. 

When I'm not teaching or doing research, I enjoy mindfulness swimming, especially going for a one-hour swim at Lancaster Aquatic Centre after dinner. I also enjoy reading history and learn about human decision making through historical stories. I originally come from Zhangqiu of Shandong (the birthplace of China’s philosophy).
